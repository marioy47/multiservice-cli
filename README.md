# Multiservice CLI Tool

This is just a personal tool to query multiple rest APIs using one single command. 

Right now it queries the following public APIs:

- Cloudflare
- NOCO
- SpinupWp
- WPEngine

Since is personal it is not submitted to [npm](https://npmjs.com) but maybe in the future it will.

## Installation

Since is not part of `npm` you have to download the code and install it manually:

```bash
cd /path/to/projects/dir
git clone git@github.com:marioy47/multiservice-cli.git services-cli
cd services-cli
npm build
npm install -g
```
